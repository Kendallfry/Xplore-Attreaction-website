This is a final project for a Html & CSS course I took during my pursiut of an associates degree in software development. 
It includes 4 pages with links on each page that will allow a user to visit any page on the site. There are a few links in the foot notes that will only take the user to the top of the page. One of the links in the foot notes will take the user to a site that belongs to a business in Mexico that encouraged the build of my site.
